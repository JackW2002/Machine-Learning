3 machine learning mini projects, used to explore how different algorithms and pipelines perform on datasets:

- Classification of car crash severity (fars dataseet)

Key Skills:
- Machine learning with models such as SVR, SVC, Descision trees.
- Data imputation
- Data scaling
- Natural Language Processing (tokenization and lemminization)

All code within this project is my own
